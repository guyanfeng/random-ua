Random UA

Protect your privacy online with random User Agents.

Every time you visit a new website, Random UA randomly selects a user agent string from a customizable list. This makes it more difficult for websites to track your browsing habits by disguising your true user agent.

Key Features:

    Randomly pick a different user agent for each new page load for increased privacy.

    Maintain a list of common user agent strings that can be edited directly from the extension settings.

    Whitelist certain sites so your real browser user agent is used for trusted domains.

    Force specific sites to always use a particular user agent for testing or compatibility.

Simple to use with no configuration required. Just install the extension to get started masking your identity online and limiting data collection.

Random UA helps you browse the web anonymously without compromising normal browser functionality or performance. Keep your personal information private while still enjoying all your favorite sites.
